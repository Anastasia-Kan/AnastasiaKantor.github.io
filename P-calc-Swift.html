										<h2 class="major">My first project on App Store</h2>
										<p>The idea to create such an application comes from my earlier experience as a scientific researcher within physics and geology. As the properties of different materials were investigated under extreme conditions - high pressures and temperatures - it was vital to know what exactly was the pressure and the temperature of the investigated sample. In order to get this information one needs to perform extra measurements and calculate the desired parameters. Many years ago my husband created <a href="http://kantor.50webs.com/ruby.htm" >a web-application</a> for this purpose, but <a href="http://kantor.50webs.com/mobile/">the mobile version</a> of it was rather poor. So my goal was to create a convenient and easy-to-use mobile application</p>
										<p>Of course, I couldnâ€™t include all the features that were available on the web as it seemed a bit too much for the first project. Instead I asked my former colleagues what features they use more often and integrated them into my app.</p>

									<p>For the beginning only the ruby fluorescence was chosen, but later on Raman spectroscopy from the diamond was added as was requested from the future users.<br><br>
									Current application contains two tabs - Ruby and Diamond - give the possibility of calculating pressure inside a diamond anvil cell either from ruby fluorescence or from a Raman spectrum from diamond. For the first case one can choose between three different calibrations: according to Shen et al., 2020 or Mao et al., 1986 - hydrostatic or non-hydrostatic conditions. As for the Raman from diamond, one can use either Raman peak from the center of the diamond culet or from a piece of diamond inside a sample chamber.<br><br>
									The user can either swipe between tabs or just tap on a desired one. In addition there is an information fragment for each tab that can be reached by tapping the Info button and containing the references for every calibration used in the application.</p>

									<p>This mobile application became my first project ever and needs to be revised in terms of code and architecture. Nevertheless, it is functionable and is published on the App Store. Some of my former colleagues are using itt and ask to integrate extra features to it.</p>
