							<h2 class="major">Emo Memo</h2>
							<p>This mobile application is a child memory game that gets your children to discover how different emotions look like on faces and how they can sound. It contains six different memory games, one with boy face expressions, one with girl face expressions, one with dad's face expressions, one with mother's face expressions, and also cats and dogs. The game is colourful and fun</p>

						<p>It was developed by a group of people (see above) for Apple devices using SwiftUI. My own input to the team work was mostly related to the game logic and app flow. At first there were only three games (mother’s, father’s and child’s emotions) in the application, but the App Store refused to accept it and insisted on extending the game, so we added three more, including a cat and a dog. It was challenging to find respective sounds, especially for the animals.</p>

							<p>In the beginning of the development process we made a lot of mistakes, not planning the complete app and game logic, to begin with. This resulted in many complications down the road. At some point we were even in need to rewrite all the code in the application in order to add win/lose checks, for example.</p>

					<div class="inner">
						<p>At the end the game was completed and it was a success. As a team we held follow-up discussion and pointed out how to avoid the same mistakes in the future.</p>
